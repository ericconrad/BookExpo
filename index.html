      <div class="synopsis">
        <h2>Sometimes life becomes so unbearable,</h2>
        <p>it's time to throw in the towel. Tom Hranicky certainly thought so.</p>

        <p>Chronically unemployed, dumped by his wife and stuck in a dead-end trailer park with nothing <br> but a three-legged dog for company, Tom decides it's time to take the Big Dirt Nap.</p>

        <p>But when he ties sixty weather balloons to a La-Z-Boy recliner to make his grand exit, something unexpected happens. He floats into heaven. Where he finds out he still has one champion in his corner: God Himself. Or Herself as in Oprah, which is how God appears to Tom.</p>

        <p>God talks a reluctant Tom into returning to earth as God's envoy, to deliver a simple one-word message to the world. But it soon becomes apparent that Tom might not be the man for the job.</p>

        <p>MIRACLE MAN is the story about a different kind of faith. The faith to believe in <br> yourself once again, long after everyone else has stopped.</p>

        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p class="oval">Bill Ford began a career as an advertising copywriter at a small agency in Los Angeles, where his initial responsibilities included taking the creative director&#39;s poodle for a nice long walk every day. He became an expert in kid-targeted advertising during a 17-year stint at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, serving as creative director on a variety of children&#39;s brands for Post  Cereals and Kraft Foods. After 25 years in the advertising wars, Bill decided to follow his muse and try his hand at fiction writing. In 2012, he said goodbye to L.A.&#39;s interminable sunshine and returned to his hometown of Baltimore, where he&#39;s still waiting for the Orioles to bring home a championship. MIRACLE MAN is his first novel.</p>

        <h3>Kirkus Reviews</h3>
        <p>"In Ford's debut novel, a depressed, slovenly man becomes an unlikely hero for mankind by bringing a message direct from God.</p>

        <p>"Ford crafts some genuinely funny, strange, and sad moments in this novel... there are some inspired moments of lunacy. [Miracle Man] is an underdog story with wild, inventive craftsmanship."</p>
